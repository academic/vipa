Here you can find usage information for JMSJobQueueBundle. For more visit http://jmsyst.com/bundles/JMSJobQueueBundle . 


##Creating Jobs
Creating jobs is super simple, you just need to persist an instance of Job:

```
<?php
$job = new Job('my-symfony2:command', array('some-args', 'or', '--options="foo"'));
$em->persist($job);
$em->flush($job);
```

##Adding Dependencies Between Jobs
If you want to have a job run after another job finishes, you can also achieve this quite easily:

```
<?php
$job = new Job('a');
$dependentJob = new Job('b');
$dependentJob->addDependency($job);
$em->persist($job);
$em->persist($dependentJob);
$em->flush();
```

##Adding Related Entities to Jobs
If you want to link a job to another entity, for example to find the job more easily, the job provides a special many-to-any association:
```
<?php

$job = new Job('a');
$job->addRelatedEntity($anyEntity);
$em->persist($job);
$em->flush();

$em->getRepository('JMSJobQueueBundle:Job')->findJobForRelatedEntity('a', $anyEntity);
```


##Schedule a Jobs
If you want to schedule a job :
```
<?php

$job = new Job('a');
$date = new DateTime();
$date->add(new DateInterval('PT30M'));
$job->setExecuteAfter($date);
$em->persist($job);
$em->flush();
```

##Fine-grained Concurrency Control through Queues
If you would like to better control the concurrency of a specific job type, you can use queues:
```
<?php

$job = new Job('a', array(), true, "aCoolQueue");
$em->persist($job);
$em->flush();
```

Queues allow you to enforce stricter limits as to how many jobs are running per queue. By default, a queue the jobs per queue are not limited as such queues will have no effect. To define a limit for a queue, you can use the bundleâ€™s configuration:
```
jms_job_queue:
    queue_options_defaults:
        max_concurrent_jobs: 3 # This limit applies to all queues (including the default queue).

    queue_options:
        foo:
            max_concurrent_jobs: 2 # This limit applies only to the "foo" queue.
```

##Prioritizing Jobs
By default, all jobs are executed in the order in which they are scheduled (assuming they are in the same queue). If you would like to prioritize certain jobs in the same queue, you can set a priority:
```
$job = new Job('a', array(), true, Job::DEFAULT_QUEUE, Job::PRIORITY_HIGH);
$em->persist($job);
$em->flush();
```

The priority is a simple integer - the higher the number, the sooner a job is executed.

##Running and Managing Jobs

app/console.v2 is a copy of app/console file but it has a different library replacement for `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Console\Application`

###listen jobs and run from queue

```
$ php app/console.v2 jms-job-queue:run
```

###clean all jobs
```
$ php app/console.v2 jms-job-queue:clean-up
```

###view queue and jobs' status

Browse [ojs-hostname]/admin/jobs to list all running or finished jobs and details with output logs.
